# Speech cut hygiene

How to cut speech so it sounds natural and every word stays whole.

## Rules

1. **Cut between phrases at real silence.** Never inside a phrase.
2. **Keep natural beats.** Pauses after a comma or list marker (0.2–0.4 s) are part of how people talk. Removing them makes speech sound robotic.
3. **Remove dead air** between phrases beyond about 0.2 s.
4. **Do not cut a filler that runs into the next word.** The cut clips the neighbours.
5. **Never speed up the voice** to tighten an edit.
6. **Do not mute a word.** Fixing a "too quick" cut by adding silence in the middle of a phrase can make the adjacent word sound muted. Fewer cuts, all between phrases, is the better fix.
7. **Let words decay.** Cut after a word has fully faded, not at the transcript end-time (transcripts often mark word ends slightly early).
8. **Never fade the last spoken word.** End the file right after it, or hold room tone.
9. **Crossfade edits** that are not in silence. Very short (2–10 ms) crossfades prevent clicks.
10. **Fill gaps with room tone**, not digital silence.

## Verifying

- Transcribe the final render and compare with the raw at every cut.
- Then **listen** at every cut. A transcript alone is not proof: speech-to-text may guess a clipped word correctly while a listener hears it broken.
- Check lip sync against the raw footage at the cut frames and in the last ten seconds.

## For synthetic narration

- Level every line to the same loudness, then limit peaks only. Scaling a whole line down to fit one loud peak makes it noticeably quieter than the others.
- Re-transcribe the finished narration and compare to the script before every render.
- Put the narration, music, and sound effects on one beat grid so changing a line moves everything together.
